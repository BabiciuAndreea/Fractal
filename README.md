# fractal_licenta
 I developed an application using the Java language to generate the most aesthetic fractals through genetic algorithms. The theoretical development was based on research in the field of genetic algorithms, aesthetics and fractals.
A set of individuals will be randomly generated to which a set of rules will be applied, and the top 8 fractals with the best scores will be displayed. The user has the possibility to select the fractals he is more attracted to, and the selected fractals will receive a bonus to the final score.
